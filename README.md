# ssh-key-and-config-generator

Node CLI to generate Ssh keys for Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab account and add it to ssh config for multiple accounts.
Tested and works on MacOS specifically.
Linux support and other hosting configs will be added soon in next versions.

##Note: Considering it **v0.0.1**, it is pretty unstable right now. Pretty much still WIP.
